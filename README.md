## Problem statement
Clinical data in CTSA hubs are not readily queryable in a federated fashion.  Many efforts exist to address this, including TriNetX, ACT, PCORNet, and OHDSI among others.  Unifying these with an HL7 FHIR framework. 

This is a sub-project of [clinical data harmonization](https://github.com/data2health/data-harmonization).
