# Clinical-Adaptor Please Read the Wiki for Details on the Clinical Adapter Project
Clinical data in CTSA hubs are not readily queryable in a federated fashion.  Many efforts exist to address this, including TriNetX, ACT, PCORNet, and OHDSI among others.  Unifying these with an HL7 FHIR framework is an aspiration. 

Enabling the CTSA to function as a federated network of clinical data, supporting multicenter research is among the core goals of the program. This proposal advances that agenda through common data model harmonization.

Note: this Repo focuses on the FDA data submission project.  This is a sub-project of [clinical data harmonization](https://github.com/data2health/data-harmonization).

## Problem statement
PENDING

## Project description
(we will migrate these from the Project Matrix for you)

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

Point person (github handle) | Site | Program Director
----------|--------------|---------------
Chris Chute (@cgchute) | JHU | Chris Chute (@cgchute)

## Leads 

Project scientific leadership, should be 1-3 persons. 

Lead(s) (github handle) | Site

## Team members 

See https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories
https://github.com/data2health/clinical-adaptor (public)
https://github.com/data2health/data-harmonization (public) Parent project repo

## Deliverables
Working draft spec for FHIR object
Prototype tooling for object generation
Demonstration of FHIR to CDM
Specification of semantic mapping challenges

## Milestones 
Completed initial set of milestones
Issues with checklists  see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).
GitHub help on Milestones is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/)

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".
