# Clinical-Adapter (See Clinical Adapter Wiki) https://github.com/data2health/clinical-adaptor/wiki

## Problem statement
Clinical data in CTSA hubs are not readily queryable in a federated fashion.  Many efforts exist to address this, including TriNetX, ACT, PCORNet, and OHDSI among others.  Unifying these with an HL7 FHIR framework is an aspiration. 

This is a sub-project of [clinical data harmonization](https://github.com/data2health/data-harmonization).

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".
